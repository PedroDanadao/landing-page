# landing-page
First landing page created as an assignment for The Odin Project.

So for this one I will be following the design provided in the landing page project(https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).
I will do it as close as I can to the provided source and will be using some random images from pexels just to make the site a bit less bleak.

People will be able to open the project directly from the navigator by accessing the project link in github after I publish it. So there is no need to
install any tool.
